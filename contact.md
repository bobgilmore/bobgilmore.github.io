About
======
I've been a Full-Stack Web Developer for several years. I'm currently a Ruby on Rails developer at [MeYou Health](http://meyouhealth.com) in Boston. I've also done:

* Ruby development at [Ascend Learning](http://www.ascendlearning.com/).  
* Full-stack web development at [OurStage](http://www.ourstage.com/).
* Subcontracting work on other RoR-based sites.

Before web development I worked in desktop software for fifteen years, specializing in desktop Java, MATLAB, and C++.

I live in [Westborough, Massachusetts](http://www.town.westborough.ma.us/Public_Documents/index), after being born and raised in upstate New York and spending a brief stint in San Diego.

Education: M.S. in [Physics (UCSD)](http://www-physics.ucsd.edu/), B.S. in [Physics (UR)](http://www.pas.rochester.edu/), Minor in [Religion (UR)](http://www.rochester.edu/College/REL/index.html).
