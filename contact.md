About
======
I'm an iOS consultant and developer, currently at [Intrepid](https://www.intrepid.io), part of [Accenture Interactive](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/interactive-index) in Cambridge, MA.

Before that, I was a full-stack web developer. I've done...

* Ruby on Rails development at [MeYou Health](http://meyouhealth.com).
* Ruby development at [Ascend Learning](http://www.ascendlearning.com/).  
* Full-stack web development at [OurStage](http://www.ourstage.com/).
* Consulting and subcontracting on other Ruby on Rails-based sites.

Before web development I worked in desktop software for fifteen years, specializing in desktop Java, MATLAB, and C++.

I live in [Westborough, Massachusetts](http://www.town.westborough.ma.us/Public_Documents/index), after being born and raised in upstate New York and spending a brief stint in San Diego.

Education: M.S. in [Physics (UCSD)](http://www-physics.ucsd.edu/), B.S. in [Physics (UR)](http://www.pas.rochester.edu/), Minor in [Religion (UR)](http://www.rochester.edu/College/REL/index.html).
