Wow, this is a bit late to the party, but I just read about Swift's `@autoclosure` attribute on [Apple's Swift blog](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=4).

It's mentioned in the context of `assert` functions, but using it to allow *users* to create lazy-evaluation functions, *a la* `||`?  Mind. Blown.

Also, the description caused a subtle shift in my understanding of closures, in the context of "lazy evaluation."  Gonna have to sleep on that!
