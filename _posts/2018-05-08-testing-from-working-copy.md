I'm doing more and more on the iPad these days, so I want to try moving to some system that lets me write and publish from here.

I'm following the lead of a bunch of iOS bloggers at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net), giving [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8) and [Pretext](https://itunes.apple.com/app/pretext/id1347707000) a try.  

We'll see how this goes!
