Bottom line on top - Markdown

One of the main reasons for starting this blog is to keep up-to-date, and experiment with, new technologies.  My current full-time position is all back-end work, so this is a way to keep my toe in the front-end water.  

While I\'m working on it, I thought I\'d start a series of posts on my technology choices.  Here goes!

First things first; ditch the old WordPress blog.  It\'s too heavyweight, and I\'m not learning a thing from that except how to be an WordPress admin.  \"WordPress Admin\" is *not* my career choice.  So, what to use?  

Technology Zero: MarkDown

Something that easily handles posts written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I think.

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  **Love** it, using it *all* the time, and *not* looking back.  I can write in it in [MultiMarkdown Composer](http://multimarkdown.com/), I can write in it in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/), I can write in it in Emacs, and I can write in it in Vim.  Done, done, done, and done!

There\'s been a lot of hullabaloo in the last week about how Apple gutted Pages.  A year and a half ago, I would have curled up into a ball and wept.  Pages was my *absolute* go-to word processor.  Now?  Don\'t care one jot.  I got a new Mac Mini about a year ago, and it took me three months to get around to noticing that I hadn\'t even installed Pages.

I\'m the Secretary of a volunteer organization in my town, and I record the meeting notes in Markdown.  My resume is written in Markdown and stored in a GitHub repo (not public *yet*).  All plaintext.  Hooray!  But how do I get \"pretty\" versions of the minutes to my fellow (non-techie) volunteers, and my resume out in the big wide world?

I use Fletcher Penney\'s [MultiMarkdown Composer](http://multimarkdown.com/) to write them.  Then I use Brett Terpstra\'s [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com/), together with a custom CSS file, to generate HTML.  Finally, I use Marked 2 and OS X\'s \"Display PDF\" pipeline to print to PDF, and distribute those PDF files hither and yon.

A few people have raised eyebrows at the \"using MultiMarkdwn for my resume\" concept.  Here are my responses:

1. I\'m a web developer.  I have **CSS** at my fingertips.  If I leave resume formatting, of **all** things, to Word, then something\'s *very* wrong.
2. I can generate .doc files from the Markdown.
3. If a target company is *so* entrenched in the Word mindset that Markdown-generated .doc is unacceptable, then I\'ll pass, thank you very much.

Wow, OK, I\'d planned on getting to my blogging platform of choice, but I didn\'t get that far.  I had to gush about the Markdown ecosystem.  [Fletcher Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/) and [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/) are just too cool for school.  More tech choices next time!
