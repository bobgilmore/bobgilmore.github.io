We finished our Christmas letter to friends and family. As web nerd-ily as possible, of course. I&hellip;

* Wrote a draft in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* Edited it with the wife via email.  She doesn't have a Markdown editor, or even a reader, but who cares?  It's plain text. That's the *point*.
* When we finished editing I checked it into a new git repo.  Because who doesn't?
* Then I dove into the CSS. Because I'm a web developer.
    * Got the `margin` right for our Christmas stationary.
    * Chose a `font-family` and `font-size`.
* Ran it through [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) to print.

Hooray for another Microsoft Word-free (*and* `troff`-free) Christmas!

The Christmas letter repo will eventually appear [on GitHub](https://github.com/bobgilmore/christmas_letters).  Not yet, though - I want to mail them first!
