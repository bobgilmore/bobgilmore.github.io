Bourbon, Neat, with a dash of Bitters.

Technology 10: Bourbon
---
When I was looking to solve some font issues, I stumbled across a reference to [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/).  Then I remembered that a old coworker, [Chris](http://echobind.com/about), introduced me to Bourbon at OurStage.  (Bourbon the mixin library, not [Bourbon, America\'s Official Native Spirit](http://kybourbontrail.com/history/) - it was *another* Chris that introduced me to *that*.)  I realized that I should add that in, since in addition to great font family support, it provides some great macros for handling vendor prefixes.

Technology 11: Neat

A few hours later, I remembered a conversation that I had with Chris at the [Beantown Pub](http://www.beantownpub.com/) after a meeting around the corner at the Boston [Thoughbot](http://thoughtbot.com/) offices.  He recommended that I look into a new layout library called [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).  Turns out that it\'s from the fine folks at Thoughtbot, as a companion to Bourbon!

Chris had been praising the semantics of Neat, but I didn\'t get it until I saw this example on the site.

Where in Bootstrap you\'d write HTML to size your columns::
{% highlight html %}
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-3">.col-md-1</div>
  <div class="col-md-9">.col-md-1</div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

In Neat, you write CSS or some variant (here, SCSS):

{% highlight scss %}
section {
  @include outer-container;
  aside { @include span-columns(3); }
  article { @include span-columns(9); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

and then associate those classes with the HTML code.

So, wait, what?  I edit *CSS* to control then onscreen appearance, rather than hard-code it into the HTML?  Oh My God, I get it!  That tears it, I\'m playing with **this**!

So, out with the Bootstrap, in with the Bourbon and Neat!

Technology 12: Bitters

Yeah, Bourbon, Neat, Bitters.  I get it.

Ripping out Bootstrap left me with a stylesheet-less page.  Ugly as sin.

Fortunately, the Thoughtbot folks fixed that, too, with [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/).  It\'s a minimal Sass library for use with Bourbon and Neat.  Not a lot, just enough to get by.

That, with a few CSS styles of my own, got me back to a decent-looking page.  It\'s not *done*, but it\'s serviceable for now.
