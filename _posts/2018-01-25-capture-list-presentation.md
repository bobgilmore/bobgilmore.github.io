Tonight I gave a presentation at the Swift Office Hours meetup ([@SwiftHours](https://twitter.com/SwiftHours)) 
at Intrepid Pursuits ([@intpd](https://twitter.com/intpd)). 

I talked about “Swift Closures, Capture Lists, and Weak References”.  

In particular, I was interested in talking about capture lists, especially how they can be used to create 
new variables in the closure.

Here are the slides:
