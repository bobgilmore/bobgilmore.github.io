I've lost the exact context for this issue, but here's an example (I've also captured relevant details in [this issue in my githooks repo](https://github.com/bobgilmore/githooks/issues/2).

In a Slim file, embed some JavaScript:

    javascript:
        alert('Slim supports embedded javascript, #{user.name(}')

... and it doesn't work correctly.  The template failed to compile.  (We know why - there's that open paren w/out a matching close.  But make believe that you *don't* know the exact cause for now.)

So, in order to debug what's going wrong, I commented out that line of JavaScript:

    javascript:
        // alert('Slim supports embedded javascript, #{user.name(}')

And compilation *still* fails.  What?  That's the only line I've changed since the working copy.  How is it failing?

As you probably guessed, The Slim transformation engine *doesn't care* that that line is commented out. When it eventually gets passed to the JavaScript interpreter, the JS interpreter will ignore the commented-out line.  But *Slim* doesn't know that; it's still going to invoke the Ruby interpreter on that string interpolation, to try to *create* the string to pass to JS.  If that Ruby expression is bad, well, **boom.**

So remember; *when working in multi-language files, always consider **which** transformation engine or interpreter is honoring each **style** of comment.*
