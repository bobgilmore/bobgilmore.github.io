[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) now [supports Markdown](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/markdown/).

That\'s great.  Maybe Wordpress installations outside of Wordpress.com do, too?  I don\'t know, and hopefully won\'t for a looooong time.

But thanks for picking up the Markdown ball and advancing it a few yards!
