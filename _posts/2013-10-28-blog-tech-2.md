Jekyll, Heroku, and Puma

OK, so I\'ve established that I want to write in Markdown.  How does that narrow the blogging software field?  It leaves a bunch of solutions available.  Heck, there\'s even a WordPress *plugin* that lets you write in Markdown.  But, damn it, I\'m tired of managing it, and I really don\'t want to have to touch PHP any more.

I looked around, and noticed that Brett Terpstra (there\'s that name again!) seemed to really like, and then finally *settle on,* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  I looked into it in some more detail, and also settled on it pretty quickly.

Technology One: Jekyll
---
I decided on Jekyll because:

* Its back end is written in Ruby, so it\'s really easy (and desirable) for me to tweak and contribute to it.
* It\'s open source, under an MIT License - my *favorite.*  I\'ll get into that someday...
* It doesn\'t use a database.  That means that the files of record are the Markdown file that I (gasp!) *check in.*
	* Yes, that means that my blog comments are under revision control (git).
* The pages are generated statically.  That\'s fine with me - it\'s a blog, not a shopping site.
*  It integrates well with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  Even though I\'m not hosting *this* blog from GitHub, I *love love love* GitHub, so I figured \"why *not* learn this tool that can work there, as well?\"

Technology Two: Heroku
----
Now that I had a technology in mind, I had to decide where to host it.  Even though GitHub was an option, I wanted to host somewhere where I\'d have to do a little bit of work, and actually learn something.  That\'s (half of) the point!  

The previous iteration of this blog was hosted in DreamHost.  Great if I need ftp access, full shell access, cron jobs, etc.  But I had a pretty turnkey solution in Jekyll, so I decided that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was a good fit.

A bit of investigation showed that there were some [Heroku Buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks) that would perform all of the static file generation at upload, without requiring me to log in and run the static file generator by hand.  Score!

Technology Three: Puma
---
Of course, there were problems.  Eventually, I found a [solution to my problems, thanks to Jesse B. Hannah](http://jbhannah.net/blog/2013/01/16/jekyll-on-heroku-without-rack-jekyll-or-custom-buildpacks.html); serve the files via Rack using the [Puma server](http://puma.io/) on Heroku.

I was curious about the Puma server, so again I investigated.  Turns out that it\'s on fire, according to New Relic\'s October 2013 [State of the Stack: Ruby Edition](http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/10/10/infographic-state-stack-ruby-edition/).  I gave Jesse\'s guide a try, and voila, I was serving Jekyll from my Heroku account!

At this point, things were working in a *really* bare-bones way.  Basic HTML with *no* styles, served from a pretty generic-looking Heroku URL, with no JavaScript.  Obviously, there\'s still some work to do, which I\'ll describe in a few days...
