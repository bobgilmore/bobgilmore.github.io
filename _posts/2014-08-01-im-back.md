It's been a *long* time since I posted - I've been busy wrapping up a job hunt, taking a [new position at MeYou Health](http://meyouhealth.com/) that I'm *super* excited about, and taking a family vacation.  

Now I'm (I hope) back to more regular posts.

I'll try to keep them shorter this time; things I learn at work (that'll mostly be Ruby and Rails), and things I learn in my free time (that'll mostly be [Go](http://golang.org/), which I'm playing with a lot).
