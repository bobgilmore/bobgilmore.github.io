I've moved the blog off of Heroku, onto GitHub.  In fact, this entry is the *real* test that the DNS changes are propagating correctly, since I'm only adding it to the *new* repo.

There was nothing wrong with Heroku, and I still user it for other projects.  It's just that what little time I have for blogging was devoted to Jekyll maintenance and updates.  Since GitHub handles that for me, I decided to make the switch.

Hopefully I'll be able to update more frequently now that maintenance is (practically) a thing of the past.
