Apple doesn't allow 3rd-party apps to integrate with Siri, but [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com) has worked around it with [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus).  I rely on this every day.  Here's how.

Omnifocus
------
Omnifocus on the Mac, iPhone, and iPod is my go-to [Getting Things Done](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done) solution.  I wouldn't get a damned thing done without it these days.  In fact, the seamless syncing between the three versions of this app constitutes The Killer App that's *guaranteed* to keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a good long while.

Create a task on any of the three platforms, and it appears on all of the others the next time you touch them.  there's a lot of other amazing features, but that synchronization is key.

Siri to Reminders
------
One big problem; you can't use Siri to create new tasks in Omnifocus, because, well, Apple knows best, and shut up *shut up* **shut up**, OK?

But, you *can* use Siri to create a reminder in Reminders.app.  Saying

> Remind me at 10PM tonight to record the Grammys

while driving to work will create the reminder that you expect, in the default Reminders list in Reminders.app.

Reminders to Omnifocus
----
Now, it's in Reminders.app.  What good does that do you?  A lot!  Because you can tell Omnifocus to monitor a *single* Reminders list and "capture" items from there into Omnifocus (deleting them from Reminders).  You can even change which Reminders list you want Omnifocus to monitor.  I left it monitoring the default Reminders list.

Omnifocus Inbox and Cleanup
----
These new items in Omnifocus may have a time and date assigned to them, but they have neither a project nor a context.  That means that they appear in the "default" container, called "Inbox."  I keep the Omnifocus Inbox clean, so if if I see something *in* Inbox, I know that it's a newly-created item from Siri (or some other automated/scripting mechanism) that needs a little TLC the next time that I'm in front of a keyboard.  In particular, it...

1. Needs a Context  (See [the GTD article](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done)).
2. Needs a Project ([Ditto](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done)).
3. Probably needs some spelling / grammar / proper noun assistance.

As to that last item; if I say

> Remind me next Thursday to push to Heroku.

, what are the odds that it got "Heroku" even close to right?  Yeah, that's what I thought.

You need to make voice reminders that will *have enough information to let you clean them up, WHEN you have the time to clean them up.*  In my case, my Task will say something about Hokaido.  If I read that tonight, I can clean it up to be about Heroku.  If I leave it for a few weeks, who knows if I'll be able to decipher it?
