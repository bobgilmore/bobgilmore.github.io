Will Airmail replace Sparrow?  Because Mail.app isn\'t in the running.

It\'s been a long time since I\'ve been a fan of Apple\'s Mail.app - it\'s just too slow to sync my (way too large) mailbox, the DB gets corrupted *way* too often, and it sucks at auto-detecting server config.  Because of that I\'ve been using [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/mac.php) for the last few years.  **Love** it!

I won\'t be running back to Mail.app any time soon, either - I\'m not on Mavericks yet (waiting for that point release bug fix!), but I\'m hearing deal-breaking [horror stories](https://twitter.com/rands/status/397745749259079680) about Mavericks\' Mail.app / Gmail integration.   So, what\'s the big deal - stick with Sparrow, right?

Well.  [Sparrow development is dead :-(](http://sparrowmailapp.com) , and I dread taking an orphaned app into a new Mac OS.  Even if things work fine, I assume that Sparrow will *never* get Mavericks tag support.  

So, time to find a new client.  Might as well do it preemptively - I assume that I\'ll have *enough* to deal with when I swap OSes.

I\'ve been hearing great things about [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/) on Twitter, so I figured I\'d give it a try.  Looks fine so far - very Sparrow-like in appearance *and* configuration.  I\'ll try it on for a few weeks and see if it feels right!

PS: Yes, I know that Apple is working on a fix.  I also know that Apple breaks Gmail support every few OS releases.  Learn to write an integration test.
