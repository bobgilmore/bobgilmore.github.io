title: Adding your Twitter Feed to Your Site
tags:

This was easy-peasy.  Was it this easy two years ago?  Were we doing something wrong?

Adding my personal Twitter feed to the site was incredibly easy, and AFAICT I don't think that (this user) is registered as a Twitter Developer!  Take *that*, Facebook!

Simply getting a Twitter feed into the site is *very* straightforward:

1. Go to [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com) and log in if you aren't already.
2. Find the "Developers" link and follow it.  (Currently goes to [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com))
3. Click the "Embedded Timelines" link, which currently takes you to [the Embedded Timelines page](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines)
4. Take a quick read of the page, so you know what your options are.  It will only take a few minutes, and come in *super* handy later.
5. In the "Creating an Embeddable Timeline" section, follow the link to [your widgets page](https://twitter.com/settings/widgets), and create a new widget.
6. Tweak whatever settings you want, then click the Save Changes button.
7. Copy the JavaScript code and paste it into the appropriate part of your page.
8. As you experiment with your page, you'll want to tweak some of the settings for this configuration.  Knock yourself out, but *be advised:* it may take a few minutes for the changes you make to be reflected in your "real" page (blog, whatever) when you refresh it.

Believe it or not, I spent more time laying out my page correctly (to have a right-rail dedicated (for now!) to Tweets), rather than adding in the feed itself.  But I like working in Sass, so that's OK! ;-)
